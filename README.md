# Web-Forum-Android-App

This is an android app I built for practice that calls REST APIs from local server to perform basic posting and commenting functionalities of a web forum.

Back-end server was built with Java using Spring Boot.  
You can find the project from [here](https://github.com/dankunlee/Web-Forum-REST-API).

Below video demonstrates how the app functions.
